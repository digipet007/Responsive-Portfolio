            <!--add image-->
            <img src="assets/images/photo(1).JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Sarah Arnold, a Seattle-based programmer">
            <p>I am a programmer in the Seattle area. 
            After completing the University of Washington's Full Stack Flex program, 
            I hope to find a challenging and impactful role that will allow me 
            to make a positive contribution to the world while continuing to develop my expertise.
            For the past six years, I have worked as an educator in the public school setting in the Chicago area, 
            teaching a variety of subjects, ranging from fifth grade sheltered instruction to ESL. 
            My background in education has provided me with an applied skillset in project management 
            and collaborating with a diverse team of professionals. After of years of service within the community, 
            I have developed an interest in creating accessible technology for education. 
            I have a Master's in Education from Dominican University with a focus in educational technology and an endorsement as 
            a Technology Specialist, which has given me a firm foundation in the application of technology
             to diversify instruction and provide access to the curriculum. I have a Bachelor's in Language, 
             Literacy, and Cultural Studies, with a minor in Teaching English as a Second Language from Western Washington University. 
             When I am not programming or teaching, I can be found hiking, 
             painting, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons with my fiance. Check out our collaborative <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/217289/The-Onyx-Fang-Part-1-Blood-on-the-Ground" class="highlight" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons story</a> on DmsGuild!</p>
